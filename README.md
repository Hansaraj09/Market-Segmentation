# Market-Segmentation
This project leverages clustering algorithms to uncover meaningful patterns within the dataset. 

To facilitate this analysis, the following Python libraries were employed:
- Seaborn: For comprehensive data visualization, enabling rich insights and clear communication of findings.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and array manipulation, underpinning the core calculations within clustering algorithms.
- Pandas: For data ingestion, manipulation, and analysis, ensuring data integrity and streamlining the process.
- Scikit-Learn: For the implementation of clustering algorithms, offering a diverse array of techniques for effective pattern identification.

The strategic integration of these libraries provides a robust and versatile framework for exploring and extracting valuable insights from the data through clustering.
