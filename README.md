# Market-Segmentation
This project leverages clustering algorithms to uncover meaningful patterns within the dataset. 

## Dependencies
To facilitate this analysis, the following Python libraries were employed:
- Seaborn: For comprehensive data visualization, enabling rich insights and clear communication of findings.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and array manipulation, underpinning the core calculations within clustering algorithms.
- Pandas: For data ingestion, manipulation, and analysis, ensuring data integrity and streamlining the process.
- Scikit-Learn: For the implementation of clustering algorithms, offering a diverse array of techniques for effective pattern identification.

The strategic integration of these libraries provides a robust and versatile framework for exploring and extracting valuable insights from the data through clustering.

## Dataset Explanation
The project takes into account two metrics for market segmentation i.e. brand loyalty and consumer satisfaction.
**Consumer Satisfaction:** In this the consumers are allowed to rate their shopping experience from 1 to 10. This datatype is discrete and it takes integer values.
**Brand Loyalty:** This dataset takes into account yearly purchases and other factors. This data type is continuous.

## Project Explanation
1.In this project, our main aim is to divide the market into different clusters and correspondingly target those customers who have high brand loyalty ad satisfaction.
2. To achieve that we  initially divide our dataset into 2 clusters in the "Loyalty" vs "Satisfaction" plane.
